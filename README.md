# Lab-Task-4
*NOTE:* This is important.
<span style="color:red">NOTE: Respected Sir,
I faced some issues with my Windows version, so I completed my assignment using an online compiler.
I have added the code in the README file on GitHub for submission.</span>

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i=1;i<=5;i++)
    {
        cout<<i<<endl;
    }
    
}
